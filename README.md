This program is designed to check your proxy list and output results.
The working results will be saved to 'valid-proxies.txt' **and** to stdout.

You can change a number of options:
- Number of threads to use can be changed from THREAD_COUNT
- Output file can be changed using OUTFILE
- Log level can be changed to output more info using LOG_LEVEL
- You can change to site to check against using SITE variable. It can be anything (google, ip-api.com, ...)
